# Tube Statuses

An SPA that shows the current status of the Tube, TFL Rail, Overground, and DLR.

## set up

This project does not require any global installs of gulp/karma, etc. Instead it should use local node_module scoping through npm scripts. However, it does require a global install of node 8 or higher.

- Install project dependencies: run `npm install`
- Start the dev task to build the project and spin up a server: `npm run dev`
- If you would like to run tests: `npm run test`
